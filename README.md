This is a sub-project of the 3DC-Validator which shows how to implement a version from the command line, using Node.js

### Usage

This folder, /cli, is designed to be extracted from the main project (3DC-Validator) and run on its own.

You need to have **Node.js** installed on your system. This project was developed with v16.13.0, but any modern version should work.

Dependencies need to be installed using npm. The main dependency is the 3DC-Validator and chalk is just used to add some color to the output.

```
npm i
```

The validator is now ready to run and the most basic usage is:

```
node index.js {schema-json-filepath}.json {glb-model-filepath}.glb
```

### glTF Multi-file (.gltf + .bin + images)

When using a multi-file .gltf, all of the files should be provided, separated by a space. They will be identified by file extension. A .gltf and .bin file are required at a minimum.

```
node index.js {schema-json-filepath}.json {gltf-model-filepath}.gltf {bin-filepath}.bin {texture-1}.jpg {texture-2}.png ...
```

### Command Line Flags

Additional flags can be used to provide product information, save the report as .csv and/or .json (both can be used with two -o's)

- -o ; without a name argument creates a .json file with the model file name and a date + timestamp. This can go anywhere except before the schema file name (which also ends with .json and would be treated as the output file name)
- -o {output-file-name}.json ; creates a json file with the report results
- -o {output-file-name}.csv ; creates a comma separated values file with the report results
- -p {product-info-file-name}.json ; Provides product dimensions to check against
- -s {schema-file-name}.json ; using the -s flag is optional, but highly recommended if providing other .json files
- -q ; quiet mode, console output will be suppressed

### Output

The report will be printed to the console by default and will show PASS / FAIL / NOT TESTED for each test available. It also shows how long it took to run.

Example output:
